At the end of the day, the goal is to put myself in the user's shoes to be able to understand the pain point better and be informed on building a delightful user-centered product.

As a tech savvy PM, I understand what is involved in building a scalable and delightful product. Skilled with effective stakeholder management.

Over the years, I've tried my hands on several thingsðŸ˜‰ from Entrepreneruship, Digital Marketing, Frontend Development and now Product Management. One way or the other, these experiences have given me unique insights into some aspect of the product lifecycle.
